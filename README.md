 Linear Algebra Worksheet Slides

This repository contains all of the daily slides that were used for an active linear algebra course taught using the seventh edition of _Elementary Linear Algebra_ by Ron Larson.

The course was taught in a flipped manner with daily worksheets completed in class.  As a four-credit course, we met four times per week.

The content for the course is here:

* [Chapter 1](slide_worksheets/chapter1) - Systems of Linear Equations
* [Chapter 2](slide_worksheets/chapter2) - Matrices
* [Proof Introduction](slide_worksheets/proof_intro) - Introduction to Proofs
* [Chapter 3](slide_worksheets/chapter3) - Determinants
* [Chapter 4](slide_worksheets/chapter4) - Vector Spaces
* [Chapter 5](slide_worksheets/chapter5) - Inner Products
* [Chapter 6](slide_worksheets/chapter6) - Linear Transformations
* [Chapter 7](slide_worksheets/chapter7) - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
